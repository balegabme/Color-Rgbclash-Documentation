        Today’s implementations of web3 gaming are largely separated into two groups. The first group consists of the
        simplest approaches of bringing games to the web3 world, which are often dry out in negative ROI gambling or
        positive ROI hold NFT that farm tokens therefore provide passive income. Not only does gambling link bad
        reputation to the crypto world, it also can get boring and pointless since it is impossible to be profitable
        long term with a coin-flip game. Passive income is often engaging to new users, but is unsustainable for the
        gaming platform, because the “farmed” token will get extremely inflationary.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The other group consists of games that try to be too complex, act as a triple A FPS game where cryptocurrencies
        are involved as takeouts from battles or NFTs acting as skins or other accessories. The issue with this group is
        that it needs to be outstandingly engaging to onboard enough players to sustain its ecosystem and pay developers
        which is not impossible however very unlikely, and development time can stretch to several years. Moreover,
        these categories have a common insufficiency and that is not fully utilizing the advantages of the web3
        infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Gambling, dedicated downloadable pc games, farming simulators are just web2 games where the payment or other
        already working solutions are replaced with web3 solutions. Our vision is that web3 gaming should stand as a
        unique experience which cannot be met anywhere else, and users can monetize their invested time not based on
        luck but based on skill.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Therefore we have made it our top priority to develop an online game in web3 that fully utilizes everything
        crypto can offer, create a healthy self-sustaining ecosystem with outstanding, innovative ideas and form a truly
        one of a kind experience for every users and ultimately, with the smart onboarding system attract many new
        people to web3 and teach them the basics of the crypto world so they will not fear deep diving into this
        fascinating universe, because blockchain inevitably is here to stay.
